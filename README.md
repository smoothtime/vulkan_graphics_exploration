A project for me learning the Vulkan api and graphics programming in general.

I've been going through Johannes Unterguggenberger's TU Wien lectures and they are great! Trying to render a triangle eventually and learn some shaders.

Plans are to get this to the state where I can treat it as a GLSL playground and load some skeletally animated models.
